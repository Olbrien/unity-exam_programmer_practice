  question: 'The Programmer is developing a spaceship battle game. Each spaceship
    has many trail renderers attached as children, and depending on the player''s
    team, their color will change accordingly. Some trail renderers are enabled only
    under certain states. The Programmer needs to create a function on the spaceship
    to change the startColor of all trail renderers.

    

    What is the correct
    implementation of SetStartColor(Color color)?'
  wrongAnswer1: 'var trails = GetComponents();

    foreach(var trail in trails)
    {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }'
  wrongAnswer2: GetComponentInChildren().startColor = color;
  wrongAnswer3: 'var trails = GetComponentsInChildren();

    foreach(var trail
    in trails) {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }'
  correctAnswer: 'var trails = GetComponentsInChildren(true);

    foreach(var trail
    in trails) {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }'
  showAnswer: 'You should use the following code to ensure the correct implementation
    of SetStartColor(Color color):

    

    var trails = GetComponentsInChildren<TrailRenderer>(true);

    foreach(var
    trail in trails) {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }

    

    GetComponentsInChildren<TrailRenderer>(true)
    returns all game objects with a TrailRenderer component, including inactive GameObjects
    because the includeInactive parameter is specified as true. Using a foreach loop,
    each trail renderer component''s color is changed to the new color.

    

    You
    should not use the following code:

    

    GetComponentInChildren<TrailRenderer>().startColor
    = color;

    

    GetComponentInChildren will only return the first GameObject
    with a TrailRenderer component (either in the parent or in the child GameObjects).
    Therefore, all other child GameObjects containing TrailRenderer components will
    have their trail color unchanged.

    

    You should not use the following
    code:

    

    var trails = GetComponentsInChildren<TrailRenderer>();

    foreach(var
    trail in trails) {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }

    

    GetComponentsInChildren<TrailRenderer>()
    returns all active game objects with a TrailRenderer Component because true is
    not passed as a parameter for includeInactive. Some TrailRenderer components
    are only enabled in certain states. This code does not ensure that those TrailRenderer
    components are updated with the new color.

    

    You should not use the
    following code:

    

    var trails = GetComponents<TrailRenderer>();

    foreach(var
    trail in trails) {

    trail.startColor = color;

    }

    

    GetComponents<TrailRenderer>()
    will only return multiple TrailRenderer components on the parent GameObject.
    Child GameObjects containing TrailRenderer components will not be included in
    this list.'
