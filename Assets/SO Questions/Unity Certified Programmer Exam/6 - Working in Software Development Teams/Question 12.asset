  question: 'A programmer is evaluating existing code for an update to a game. Currently
    all NPCs inherit from one of two classes, both of which inherit from Monobehaviour:

    

    .Animal:
    This class includes code for moving, eating, and social interactions. An Animator
    is cached in the Awake method to animate the NPC.

    

    .Plant: This class
    includes code for reacting to soil conditions, and for generating fruit and seeds.
    The only Light in the scene is cached in the Awake method to determine when photosynthesis
    occurs.

    

    The update introduces burrowing animals that need to react
    to soil conditions. What steps should the programmer take to write functionality
    for these new animals?'
  wrongAnswer1: Convert Plant to an interface. Create a new class named BurrowingAnimal
    that inherits from the Animal class and the Plant interface.
  wrongAnswer2: Create a new class named BurrowingAnimal that inherits from both
    the Animal and Plant classes.
  wrongAnswer3: Convert Animal and Plant to interfaces. Create a new class named
    BurrowingAnimal that inherits from both Animal and Plant interfaces.
  correctAnswer: Create a new class named BurrowingAnimal that inherits from Animal.
    Include a method for reacting to soil conditions.
  showAnswer: 'The programmer should create a new class named BurrowingAnimal that
    inherits from Animal and write the functionality for reacting to soil here. Portions
    of the Plant code may be copied, but the class will not inherit from Plant.

    

    The
    programmer cannot create a class that inherits from both Animal and Plant. A
    class in C# cannot inherit from multiple classes. A class can inherit from only
    one class and any number of interfaces. However, Animal and Plant cannot be converted
    to interfaces because they inherit from Monobehaviour and rely on the Awake method.'
