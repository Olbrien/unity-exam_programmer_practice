  question: "A Programmer is creating a simulation of a basketball game. The Programmer
    adds a Sphere game object to a scene. The Programmer wants to programmatically
    disable the sphere collider of the Sphere. The script for the Sphere is as follows:\n\n01
    public class Sphere : MonoBehaviour \r\n02 {\r\n03   void Start()\r\n04     {\r\n05\r\n06    
    }\r\n07 }    \r\n\r\nWhich code segment should the Programmer use at line 05?\r"
  wrongAnswer1: GetComponent(typeof(SphereCollider)).enabled = false;
  wrongAnswer2: sphereCollider.enabled = false;
  wrongAnswer3: SphereCollider.enabled = false;
  correctAnswer: GetComponent().enabled = false;
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use the following code:

    

    GetComponent<SphereCollider>().enabled
    = false;

    

    GetComponent<T> is a generic method that returns an instance
    of the type specified by T. GetComponent<SphereCollider> returns an instance
    of SphereCollider. It then sets the enabled property to false to disable the
    sphere collider.

    

    The Programmer should not use the following code:

    

    sphereCollider.enabled
    = false;

    

    This code requires an instance named sphereCollider, which
    has not been returned in the code in this scenario.

    

    The Programmer
    should not use the following code:

    

    GetComponent(typeof(SphereCollider)).enabled
    = false;

    

    The non-generic GetComponent method returns an instance
    of type Component. Therefore, the Programmer would need to cast Component to
    SphereCollider.

    

    The Programmer should not use the following code:

    

    SphereCollider.enabled
    = false;

    

    This assumes that the enabled property is static. However,
    it is an instance property. Therefore, you must retrieve an instance of SphereCollider
    to set its enabled property.'
