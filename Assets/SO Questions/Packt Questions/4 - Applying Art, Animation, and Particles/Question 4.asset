  question: 'In our first-person shooter, we have just hooked up our marine''s space

    cannon''s
    Finite State Machine so that it fires the projectile.

    When the cannon is
    fired, there is a banging sound, particle effects fountain

    out from the
    cannon, and a beam fires outward.


    Currently, the only thing the beam can
    come into contact with is a wall,

    which has a collider attached to it.

    When
    the beam hits the wall, there is another particle that is triggered when

    the
    impact of the surface hits. During this explosion, we shrink then destroy

    the
    beam.


    Which event should we expect the beam to be destroyed in?'
