  question: "A Programmer writes the following code to rotate a player indefinitely:\r\n\r\npublic
    class PlayerController\r\n {\r\n   void Update()\r\n     {\r\n         if (isLocalPlayer)\r\n          
    transform.Rotate(0, 10, 0);\r\n     }\r\n\r\nThe code fails to compile. The Programmer
    discovers that the code fails to recognize the isLocalPlayer property.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should the Programmer do to fix the code?"
  wrongAnswer1: Change the Update method to Start.
  wrongAnswer2: Derive PlayerController from MonoBehaviour.
  wrongAnswer3: Change the Update method to OnStartLocalPlayer.
  correctAnswer: Derive PlayerController from NetworkBehaviour.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should fix this code by deriving PlayerController from
    NetworkBehaviour. The isLocalPlayer property of the NetworkBehaviour class specifies
    whether or not the script that is running represents the local player in a network-connected
    game.

    

    The Programmer should not derive PlayerController from MonoBehaviour.
    The isLocalPlayer property is not a member of that class.

    

    The Programmer
    should not change the Update method to Start. The Update method is called once
    per frame. This is necessary so that the player can rotate accordingly. The Start
    method is only called once.

    

    The Programmer should not change the
    Update method to OnStartLocalPlayer. The Update method is called once per frame.
    This is necessary so that the player can rotate accordingly. The OnStartLocalPlayer
    method is only called once.'
