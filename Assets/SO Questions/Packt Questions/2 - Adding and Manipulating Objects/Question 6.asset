  question: 'Another situation that has been pointed out from our game designer is
    that

    when we are playing our side-scrolling platform game, the character
    takes

    a while to pick up speed. Also, when the character is running full
    speed

    one way and then we change direction on the gamepad, there appears
    to be

    too much deceleration before the character picks up speed in the
    new

    direction.


    What do we need to change with our current input
    to make the direction

    more snappy?'
