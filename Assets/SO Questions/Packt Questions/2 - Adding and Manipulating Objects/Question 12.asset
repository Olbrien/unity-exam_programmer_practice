  question: 'Being an enthusiastic indie developer, you have decided to make a spiritual

    successor
    to the game "Desert Bus." You have nearly finished developing

    the game
    and decided to add some optimizations. You have decided to

    make it so that
    any of the smaller 3D assets such as pebbles, small plants,

    and insects
    should not be rendered at a far distance, only when close up.

    We should
    still be able to see the larger assets, no matter what distance we

    are
    from them.


    Which camera property would you use to help achieve this?'
  wrongAnswer1: farClipPlane
