  question: 'You are making a sci-fi arcade shooter game. The gamer''s view has a
    UI

    display wrapped around the screen with lots of vital details about your

    mission
    and your ship''s health. In the lower corner of the screen, we have a

    3D
    view of the condition of our ship. Whenever the ship takes damage, we

    can
    see the results in our 3D view, along with particle effects to emphasize

    the
    damage. Each possible damage point on the ship in the 3D view has a

    collider
    that reacts if a missile hits it.


    In testing, you realize the ship in
    the 3D view has enemy missiles bouncing

    off your colliders when they''re
    supposed to be damaging your ship.


    How should the programmer solve this
    issue while retaining the

    functionality of both the in-game objects and
    the UI?'
  wrongAnswer1: Increase the Mass of the missiles to get through the collider.
  wrongAnswer2: 'Add a second collider to all the colliders on the ship to increase
    its

    probability.'
  wrongAnswer3: 'Add one main collider to go around the ship so that when a missile
    hits

    it, this will disable all the colliders inside for a split second.'
  correctAnswer: "In the Layer Collision Matrix, turn off collisions between the
    3D UI ship\r\nlayer and the missile and asteroid layers.\r"
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
