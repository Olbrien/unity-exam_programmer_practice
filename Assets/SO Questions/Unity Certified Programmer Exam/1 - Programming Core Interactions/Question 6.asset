  question: 'A Programmer is working on a soccer game and must implement the goal
    detection mechanism. In order to detect when the ball enters the goal area, the
    Programmer decides to use a Sphere Collider on the ball Gameobject in conjunction
    with a RigidBody component and a Box Collider for the goal Gameobject.

    

    The
    Programmer wants to be able to detect when the ball Gameobject has entered the
    goal Gameobject.

    

    What should the Programmer do?'
  wrongAnswer1: Set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to true and detect the goal
    using the OnCollisionEnter method implemented in a ball script.
  wrongAnswer2: Set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to false and detect the goal
    using the OnControllerColliderHit method implemented in a ball script.
  wrongAnswer3: Set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to false and detect the goal
    using the OnCollisionEnter method implemented in a ball script.
  correctAnswer: Set the Box Collider for the goal isTrigger to true, and detect
    the ball using an OnTriggerEnter method.
  showAnswer: "The Programmer should set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to true
    and detect the goal using the OnTriggerEnter method. By setting the isTrigger
    to true, Unity will invoke the method OnTriggerEnter as soon as the Gameobject
    intersects with any other collider in the scene.\r\n\r\nThe Programmer should
    not should set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to false and detect the goal
    using the OnCollisionEnter method. By not setting the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger
    to true, Unity physics will prevent the ball from entering the goal, as if the
    goal was a solid square block.\r\n\r\nThe Programmer should not set the ball
    Sphere Collider isTrigger to true and detect the goal using the OnCollisionStay
    method. The OnCollisionStay method will be invoked every frame while the ball
    is inside the goal's Box Collider, and not only once when it enters. \r\n\r\nThe
    Programmer should not set the ball Sphere Collider isTrigger to true and detect
    the goal using the OnCollisionEnter method. The OnCollisionEnter method is only
    called when none of the Colliders involved has the isTrigger set to true."
