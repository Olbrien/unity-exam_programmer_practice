  question: 'A Programmer develops an inventory system for a quest-based game in
    which players collect items. The Programmer decides to write unit tests for the
    inventory system.

    

    What qualifies as an optimal unit test?'
  wrongAnswer1: When a player collects an item, test whether the item gets added
    to the inventory.
  wrongAnswer2: When a player collects an item, test whether the appropriate sound
    clip is played for the action.
  wrongAnswer3: If a player collects an item, test whether the item gets added to
    the inventory and the player receives a notification.
  correctAnswer: If a player has nothing in inventory and collects an item, test
    whether the inventory has exactly one item.
  showAnswer: 'Testing whether the inventory has exactly one item if a player has
    nothing in inventory and collects an item is an optimal unit test. Because the
    collection of one item in an inventory of known quantity is tested, the result
    is predictable.

    

    Testing whether the item gets added to the inventory
    when a player collects an item does not qualify as an optimal unit test. In this
    case, even if the test succeeds in adding an item to the inventory, it does not
    thoroughly test how the inventory slots are handled.

    

    Testing whether
    the item gets added to the inventory and the player receives a notification is
    not an optimal unit test. In this case, two separate things are tested: the inventory
    and the notification. Unit tests should test only one single feature or behavior.
    Also, notification has nothing to do with the inventory system itself.

    

    Testing
    whether the appropriate sound clip is played for the action when a player collects
    an item is not an optimal unit test. Because the sound clip should be independent
    of the inventory system, it should not be part of the unit test.'
