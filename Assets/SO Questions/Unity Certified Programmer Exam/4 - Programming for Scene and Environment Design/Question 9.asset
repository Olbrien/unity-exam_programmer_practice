  question: "A Programmer writes the following code to dynamically create cubes:\r\n\r\npublic
    class CubeInstantiator: MonoBehaviour \r\n{\r\n   void Start()\r\n     {\r\n        
    for (int z = 0; z < 5; z++) \r\n         {             \r\n             GameObject
    cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);\r\n             cube.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();\r\n            
    cube.transform.position = new Vector3(0, 0, z);\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhere
    is each new cube placed when it is created?"
  wrongAnswer1: Directly behind the previous cube.
  wrongAnswer2: Directly to the right of the previous cube.
  wrongAnswer3: Directly to the left of the previous cube.
  correctAnswer: Directly in front of the previous cube.
  showAnswer: "The cubes are placed directly in front of the previous cube. The z
    axis represents forward motion in a simulation. In this scenario, the value of
    z increases by one in a loop for five times. This places each cube directly in
    front of the previous one.\r\n\r\nThe cubes are not placed directly behind the
    previous cube. For this to happen, the value of z must decrease by one each time.\r\n\r\nThe
    cubes are not placed directly to the left or right of the previous cube. For
    this to happen, you must change the value of x, which is the first parameter
    to the Vector3 constructor.\r"
