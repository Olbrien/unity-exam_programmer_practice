  question: "A Programmer is working on a virtual reality (VR) arcade game in which
    the player is a blind samurai and must defend himself or herself against enemies
    that approach on their position. The Game Design Document (GDD) states that the
    player using headphones hears the enemy footsteps and must rotate left or right
    to fend off incoming attacks. When an enemy is close to attacking, the tone and
    tempo of the footsteps raise to alert the player to block an attack to account
    for the samurai's senses. \r\n\r\nWhich AudioSource property will create this
    effect?"
  wrongAnswer1: time
  wrongAnswer2: volume
  wrongAnswer3: spatialBlend
  correctAnswer: pitch
  showAnswer: 'You should use the pitch property on AudioSource to create this effect.
    Decreasing the pitch property makes the tone of the clip sound lower, which alerts
    the player that an attack is coming.

    

    You should not use the volume
    property on AudioSource to create this effect. Changing the volume increases
    or decreases the level of sound coming from an AudioClip but does not make the
    sound faster or slower.

    

    You should not use the time property on
    AudioSource to create this effect. The time property specifies the clip''s playback
    position but does not make the sound faster or slower.

    

    You should
    not use the spatialBlend property on AudioSource to create this effect. This
    property determines whether an AudioSource is heard as a 2D or 3D source but
    does not make the sound faster or slower.'
