  question: 'A Programmer is optimizing a desktop game so that it can run on mobile
    devices. The Programmer wants to ensure that the game uses less memory on mobile
    devices.

    

    Which optimization should the Programmer make?'
  wrongAnswer1: Remove all code that uses object pooling.
  wrongAnswer2: Use "" instead of String.Empty.
  wrongAnswer3: Use string concatenation with the + operator.
  correctAnswer: Change any structs that are passed to a method to classes.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should change structs to classes if they are passed
    around. When you pass a class instance to a method, a reference to the class
    is passed. Therefore, another object is not created in memory. However, when
    you pass a struct to a method, a separate copy of the struct is created in memory.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use "" instead of String.Empty. C# treats "" as an empty
    object that is placed in memory, but String.Empty does not.

    

    The
    Programmer should not remove all code that uses object pooling. Object pooling
    uses less memory because objects are reused.

    

    The Programmer should
    not use string concatenation with the + operator. Each time you use the + operator
    to concatenate a string, a new string is created in memory.'
