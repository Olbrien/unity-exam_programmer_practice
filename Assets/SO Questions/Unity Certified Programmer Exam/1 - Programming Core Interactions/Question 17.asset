  question: 'A Programmer must create an overlay that can render individual 3D models
    on top of a 3D scene. When the avatar picks up an item, the item must be rendered
    on top of everything else for a few seconds. The world must be rendered with
    the main camera, and the item overlay must be rendered with another camera. The
    item must rotate while shown.


    What should the item camera''s settings be?'
  wrongAnswer1: Clear Flags should be set to Don't clear, and the Camera Depth must
    be set to a lower value than the main camera.
  wrongAnswer2: Clear Flags should be set to Don't clear, and the Camera Depth must
    be set to a higher value than the main camera.
  wrongAnswer3: Clear Flags should be set to Depth only, and the Camera Depth must
    be set to a lower value than the main camera.
  correctAnswer: Clear Flags should be set to Depth only, and the Camera Depth must
    be set to a higher value than the main camera.
  showAnswer: 'You should set Clear Flags to Depth only, and the CameraDepth to a
    higher value than the main camera to create this overlay. This ensures that anything
    opaque that is rendered by the item camera will render on top of anything rendered
    by the main camera.


    You should not set Clear Flags to Don''t clear and
    the Camera Depth to a higher value than the main camera to create this overlay.
    The Don''t clear setting means that the camera does not clear its buffers before
    the next frame, which causes both images to blend in the subsequent frames.


    You
    should not set Clear Flags to Don''t clear and the Camera Depth to a lower value
    than the main camera to create this overlay. The Don''t clear setting means that
    the camera does not clear its buffers before the next frame, which causes both
    images to blend in the subsequent frames. Also, the lower Depth value will cause
    the main camera to be drawn on top of the item camera, which hides the item.


    You
    should not set Clear Flags to Depth only and the Camera Depth to a lower value
    than the main camera to create this overlay. The lower Camera Depth value causes
    the main camera to be drawn on top of the item camera, which hides the item.'
