  question: 'While testing, a Programmer notices a frame drop on older computers,
    which the Programmer traces back to high texture memory usage. The Programmer
    must create a menu that will allow the user to choose buttons marked Low, Medium,
    or High to only change the size of the textures used by the application. These
    buttons will also have an associated int buttonValue. The Programmer will use
    the QualitySettings class.

    

    Which script snippet allows the dynamic
    change of texture resolution based on the user''s platform choice?'
  wrongAnswer1: QualitySettings.resolutionScalingFixedDPIFactor = buttonValue
  wrongAnswer2: QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel(buttonValue)
  wrongAnswer3: QualitySettings.maximumLODLevel = buttonValue
  correctAnswer: QualitySettings.masterTextureLimit = buttonValue
  showAnswer: 'You should set QualitySettings.masterTextureLimit = buttonValue to
    allow the dynamic change of texture resolution. The default value is 0. For each
    increment of 1, the texture size is divided in half.

    

    You should
    not set QualitySettings.maximumLODLevel = buttonValue to allow the dynamic change
    of texture resolution. The maximumLODLevel method is responsible for changing
    the level of detail on 3D objects.

    

    You should not call QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel(buttonValue)
    to allow the dynamic change of texture resolution. The SetQualityLevel method
    changes the entire quality settings, not only the size of the textures.

    

    You
    should not set QualitySettings.resolutionScalingFixedDPIFactor = buttonValue
    to allow the dynamic change in texture resolution. The resolutionScalingFixedDPIFactor
    method is used in conjunction with the target Fixed DPI to define the actual
    Fixed DPI.'
