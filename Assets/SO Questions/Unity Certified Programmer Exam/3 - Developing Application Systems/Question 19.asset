  question: "A Programmer writes the following code for an online game:\r\n\r\npublic
    class Timer : NetworkBehaviour\r\n{\r\n  public int time = 60;\r\n}\r\n\r\nOther
    game objects use this class to determine when the game is over. When the Programmer
    tests the game as two players, the value of time is sometimes different between
    the two players. The Programmer verifies that only the Timer class changes the
    time member.\r\n\r\nWhat is likely the cause of this problem?"
  wrongAnswer1: The time member is public.
  wrongAnswer2: The Timer class does not inherit MonoBehaviour.
  wrongAnswer3: The [Client] attribute must be applied to the time member.
  correctAnswer: The Timer instances are not synched.
  showAnswer: 'The Timer instances are not synched. To sync the Timer instances,
    the Programmer should apply the [SyncVar] attribute to the time member. This
    causes the value of the member to be synced to all clients at the end of the
    current frame whenever its value is changed.

    

    The Timer class should
    not inherit MonoBehaviour. The Timer class should inherit NetworkBehaviour because
    it contains networking functionality. NetworkBehaviour inherits MonoBehaviour.

    

    The
    time member should be public. Having it marked as public allows other game objects
    to access the time member.

    

    The [Client] attribute should not be
    applied to the time member. This attribute should be applied to methods to indicate
    that they should be invoked only from network clients.'
