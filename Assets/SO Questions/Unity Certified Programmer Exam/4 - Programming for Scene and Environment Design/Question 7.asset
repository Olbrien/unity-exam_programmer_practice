  question: 'A Programmer creates a procedurally generated maze composed of a small
    set of high detail 3D tiles. These tiles are matched up to each other to create
    a continuous environment. Each environment has its own color and material. The
    Programmer views the scene with the Frame Debugger and notes that the tiles are
    not batching. Many extra draw calls are occurring.

    

    What should the
    Programmer do to reduce draw calls?'
  wrongAnswer1: Use Mesh.CombineMeshes() to merge tiles together.
  wrongAnswer2: Set gameObject.isStatic on each tile to true.
  wrongAnswer3: Set the Renderer's sortingOrder to a unique value.
  correctAnswer: Make the tiles share the same material.
  showAnswer: 'You should make the tiles share the same material to reduce draw calls.
    This ensures that the tiles are dynamically batched in the same draw call. Each
    mesh with a different material results in additional draw calls.

    

    You
    should not set gameObject.isStatic on each tile to true to reduce draw calls
    because the maze is procedurally generated. A gameObject can be set to static
    only if it exists at edit time and it is not moved or modified in any manner
    during run time.

    

    You should not set the Renderer''s sortingOrder
    to a unique value to reduce draw calls. The sortingOrder property changes the
    order within a sorting layer but does not affect the number of draw calls.

    

    You
    should not use Mesh.CombineMeshes() to merge tiles to reduce draw calls. If each
    mesh uses a different material, combining meshes does not reduce the number of
    draw calls.'
