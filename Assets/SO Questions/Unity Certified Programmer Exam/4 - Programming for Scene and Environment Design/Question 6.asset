  question: 'A Programmer must write code to send messages from a transmitter component
    to receiver components on child GameObjects that implement a TreeDied() function.

    

    The
    Programmer has an example of a tree with leaves. Some portions of these leaves
    have the receivercomponent. When the tree dies, it must send a message to these
    leaves.

    

    Which function should be used to solve this problem?'
  wrongAnswer1: BroadcastMessage("TreeDied", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver);
  wrongAnswer2: SendMessageUpwards("TreeDied", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver);
  wrongAnswer3: SendMessage("TreeDied", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver);
  correctAnswer: BroadcastMessage("TreeDied", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver);
  showAnswer: "You should use the BroadcastMessage(\"TreeDied\", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver)
    function to solve this problem. The BroadcastMessage calls the TreeDied method
    on every MonoBehaviour in gameObject and any of its children. Because not all
    leaves have a receiver component, the SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver
    function ensures that GameObjects that do not have a MonoBehaviour with a method
    TreeDied defined are ignored.\r\n\r\nYou should not use the BroadcastMessage(\"TreeDied\",
    gameObject, SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver) function to solve this problem.
    Although the BroadcastMessage calls the TreeDied method on gameObject and its
    children, not all leaves have a receiver component added. The parameter SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver
    results in an error message when it attempts to call the TreeDied method on GameObjects
    that do not have the receiver component.\r\n\r\nYou should not use the SendMessageUpwards(\"TreeDied\",
    gameObject, SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver) function to solve this problem.
    The SendMessageUpwards function attempts to call the TreeDied method on the gameObject
    and on every ancestor of gameObject. Because the gameObject (the tree) does not
    contain a TreeDied method, the use of this function results in an error message.\r\r\n\r\nYou
    should not use the SendMessage(\"TreeDied\", gameObject, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver)
    function to solve this problem. The SendMessage function calls the TreeDied method
    on the gameObject only. It does not call the method on any of its child gameObjects
    that contain the receiver component."
