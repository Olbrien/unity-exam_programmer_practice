  question: 'A Programmer is creating a feature by which GameObjects that obscure
    the user''s center of interest become transparent by changing the material of
    occluding objects. As the simulation progresses, the number of draw calls per
    frame steadily increases.

    

    The Frame Debugger shows that identical
    instances of objects are no longer being batched.

    

    What is the root
    cause of the issue?'
  wrongAnswer1: The Programmer has set the Rendering Path to Legacy Deferred.
  wrongAnswer2: The Programmer is setting the opacity on Renderer.sharedMaterial.
  wrongAnswer3: The Programmer has not marked the occluding GameObjects as Batching
    static.
  correctAnswer: The Programmer is setting Renderer.material instead of Renderer.sharedMaterial.
  showAnswer: "The root cause of the issue is that you set Renderer.material instead
    of Renderer.sharedMaterial. Objects are automatically batched only when certain
    criteria are met, including when the GameObjects share material. If Renderer.material
    is used, the GameObjects are using different copies of a material. \r\n\r\nThe
    root cause of the issue is not that you are setting the opacity on Renderer.sharedMaterial.
    While changing the opacity and having transparency may affect performance, it
    is not the reason for objects not being batched.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the
    issue is not that you have set the Rendering Path to Legacy Deferred. While it
    is true that Legacy Deferred lighting cannot support rendering semi-transparent
    objects, it does not affect batching.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is not
    that you have not marked the occluding GameObjects as Batching static. Because
    the batching suddenly broke during runtime, the setup for batching is correct
    and cannot be the root cause."
