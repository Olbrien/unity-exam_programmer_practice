# Perguntas Unity

This is an app that I made to practice for the [Unity Certified Programmer Exam](https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications).

It has two modes, Practice and Exam.
Half the questions are from oficial sources and the other half are from the book [Unity Certified Programmer Exam Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/product/unity-certified-programmer-exam-guide/9781838828424).

I've made this app as close as possible to the [Measure Up](https://www.measureup.com) exam format.\
The GUI was all made on Unity.

It works on all phone dimensions.\
Questions are random.\
You can choose to do mock tests, specific topics, with or without timer and real exam scenario.\
It also saves your best exam, your worst and your latest.

You can test this app on any Android device. You can find the .apk at the folder [Extras](https://github.com/Olbrien/unity-exam_programmer_practice/tree/main/Extras).
