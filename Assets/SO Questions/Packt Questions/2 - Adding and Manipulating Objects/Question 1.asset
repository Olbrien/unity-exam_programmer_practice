  question: 'You have been asked by your head of development to make it so whenever

    a
    player walks through a doorway, a light next to the door will turn on.

    You
    have made an OnTriggerEnter() script that enables a light and

    added a collider
    to your doorway with a Rigidbody. Your player has a

    collider and Rigidbody
    as well. When you run the game to test your code,

    the light doesn''t turn
    on.


    What is most likely the cause of this issue? '
  wrongAnswer1: The light game object needs a trigger as well.
  wrongAnswer2: You don't need multiple Rigidbody components.
  wrongAnswer3: The doorway isn't connected up to the light.
  correctAnswer: The doorway's collider is not marked as a trigger.
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
