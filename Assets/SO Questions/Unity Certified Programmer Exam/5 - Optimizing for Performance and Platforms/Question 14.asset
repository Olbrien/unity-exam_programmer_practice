  question: 'An XR project is under development using Deferred Rendering. The GPU
    has been identified as the limiting resource, but the Designer has deemed anti-aliasing
    is necessary.

    

    Which type of anti-aliasing should the Programmer
    introduce to the project?'
  wrongAnswer1: SMAA
  wrongAnswer2: MSAA
  wrongAnswer3: TAA
  correctAnswer: FXAA
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use Fast Approximate Anti-aliasing (FXAA). It
    is supported in Deferred Rendering and is the least demanding on the GPU.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use Subpixel Morphological Anti-aliasing (SMAA) or Temporal
    Anti-aliasing (TAA), although both are supported by Deferred Rendering. Each
    is more demanding on the GPU, which is being pushed to its limit.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use Multisample Anti-aliasing (MSAA). That is an option
    for Forward Rendering.'
