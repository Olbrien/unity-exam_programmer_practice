  question: 'A band simulator game is under development and nearing closed beta.
    A Programmer is working to add functionality to the drum portion. There is an
    AudioSource attached to the drum. Due to the architecture of the game, a second
    AudioSource cannot be added.

    

    Players will use a gamepad to play
    the drum. Each press of the trigger will strike the drum. The volume depends
    on how quickly the trigger is pressed down. Quick presses cause loud sounds,
    and soft presses cause quiet sounds. The player is supposed to keep the beat
    but can make a lot of noise if they rapidly press the triggers on the gamepad.

    

    Which
    method should the Programmer use to make the drum sounds?'
  wrongAnswer1: PlayScheduled
  wrongAnswer2: Play
  wrongAnswer3: PlayOnGamepad
  correctAnswer: PlayOneShot
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use PlayOneShot. This allows a single AudioSource
    to play multiple overlapping sounds without interrupting a sound in progress.
    Furthermore, each sound played in this manner can have its volume set independent
    of the other sounds being played. A player can rapid-fire drum beats of different
    volume levels using PlayOneShot.

    

    The Programmer should not use Play.
    This would interrupt any sound in progress from the AudioSource. Even if the
    game allowed for multiple AudioSources for the drum, that could still be a large
    number of AudioSources, but PlayOneShot deals with the problem easily.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use PlayOnGamepad. This sets the AudioSource to play through
    a particular gamepad. This might be useful to allow the drummer to hear themselves
    clearly through their gamepad, but it will not deliver the functionality required.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use PlayScheduled. This plays a sound at a particular time.
    Like Play, this will interrupt any current sound being played. Unlike Play, it
    delays playing of the sound, which is not what this game needs.'
