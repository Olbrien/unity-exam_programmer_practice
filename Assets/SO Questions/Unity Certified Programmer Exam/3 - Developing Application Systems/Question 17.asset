  question: 'A Programmer uses the following code to serialize game data in Unity:

    

    01
    SaveGameData(GameData gameData, String filePath)

    02 {

    03   var serializedData
    = JsonUtility.ToJson(gameData);

    04 }

    

    The Programmer wants
    to save the game data to the file represented by filePath. The file must be created
    unless the file already exists. If the file already exists, the file must be
    overwritten.

    

    Which code segment should the Programmer use?'
  wrongAnswer1: new XDocument(serializedData).SaveAsync();
  wrongAnswer2: new StreamWriter(serializedData).WriteLine();
  wrongAnswer3: File.CreateText(filePath).Write(serializedData);
  correctAnswer: File.WriteAllText(filePath, serializedData);
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use the following code:

    

    File.WriteAllText(filePath,
    serializedData);

    

    The WriteAllText method of the File class writes
    text data to a file.

    

    The Programmer should not use the following
    code:

    

    new StreamWriter(serializedData).WriteLine();

    

    The
    StreamWriter class enables you to write text or object data to a file. However,
    the constructor should represent the file name.

    

    The Programmer should
    not use the following code:

    

    File.CreateText(filePath).Write(serializedData);

    

    The
    CreateText method throws an exception if the file already exists.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use the following code:

    

    new XDocument(serializedData).SaveAsync();

    

    The
    XDocument class represents an XML document, not a JSON document.'
