  question: 'A Programmer is developing a mining simulation game where the player
    can dig through the ground in search of minerals. In one of the sites, the player
    can create a tunnel that intersects an existing cave system. The Design Document
    specifies that any audio that occurs in both the current caves or new tunnels
    should have some reverb. The Programmer needs to make sure the user is consistently
    in the closest cave''s ReverbZone.

    

    How should the Programmer manipulate
    the AudioReverbZone properties to meet these requirements?'
  wrongAnswer1: Increase the decayTime on the new area.
  wrongAnswer2: Increase the reverb to accommodate the new area.
  wrongAnswer3: Increase the reflections to fit the new area.
  correctAnswer: Increase the maxDistance to fit the new area.
  showAnswer: 'You should increase the maxDistance to fit the new area. The maxDistance
    property specifies the maximum distance from the centerpoint that the reverb
    effect should reach.

    

    You should not increase the reflections to
    fit the new area. The reflections property refers to the level of early reflections
    relative to room effect.

    

    You should not increase the reverb on the
    new area. The reverb property controls the late reverb level relative to room
    effect.

    

    You should not increase the decayTime to accommodate the
    new area. The decayTime property controls the reverb decay time at mid frequencies.'
