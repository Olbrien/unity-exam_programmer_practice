  question: 'A simulator has a variety of animals roaming an area with various obstacles
    and points of interest. Currently there are chickens, mice, and horses. The animals
    navigate the area using the Unity Navigation System. Animals will seek out food
    when hungry and bedding when sleepy. If neither condition applies, animals will
    move in a manner specific to their species. Chickens wander randomly and cluster
    in groups. Mice run from hiding spot to hiding spot. Horses gallop for a time
    before resting and then repeat the process.

    

    Currently there is an
    issue when a horse is moving to get food or bedding. If it encounters a cluster
    of chickens, it will move around the cluster rather than walk through them. A
    horse walking around a sufficiently-sized cluster of chickens can take minutes
    to get to its destination, when walking through the cluster would take seconds.
    The Designer wants the chickens to move out of the way of a horse.

    

    What
    should the Programmer do to make the horse walk through the cluster of chickens?'
  wrongAnswer1: Reduce the radius value of the chickens' NavMeshAgent until there
    is a clear path for a horse through a cluster.
  wrongAnswer2: Set the autoRepath value of a chicken's NavMeshAgent to true while
    not seeking food or bedding.
  wrongAnswer3: Increase the obstacleAvoidanceType of each horse's NavMeshAgent to
    ObstacleAvoidanceType.HighQualityObstacleAvoidance.
  correctAnswer: Set the avoidancePriority of each horse's NavMeshAgent to be lower
    than every chicken's avoidancePriority.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should lower the avoidancePriority of each horse''s
    NavMeshAgent until it is less than that of the chickens. Avoidance priority determines
    the importance of a NavMeshAgent when calculating avoidance with other NacMeshAgents.
    A lower value will give a horse priority and cause the chickens to avoid the
    horse as it moves to its destination.

    

    The Programmer should not
    reduce the radius of the chickens. This will allow chickens to intersect obstacles
    in the world as well as each other.

    

    The Programmer should not increase
    the obstacleAvoidanceType of the horses. This will make the horses avoid obstacles
    sooner and smoother, but it will not allow them to push through a cluster if
    the other NavMeshAgents form a barrier.

    

    The Programmer should not
    set autoRepath to false on the chickens while not seeking food or bedding. This
    will cause the cluster to behave poorly. A cluster of chickens will continuously
    invalidate paths of its members, and repathing will be required. It will also
    not allow a horse to cross the cluster.
