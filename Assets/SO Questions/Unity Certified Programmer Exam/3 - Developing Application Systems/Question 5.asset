  question: "A Programmer is developing an application for iOS platforms that lets
    users furnish their own virtual homes. The application offers a single, non-consumable
    IAP that grants users a special couch item to add to their inventory.\r\n\r\nThe
    users must be able to retain purchases between multiple devices and installations.
    The Programmer writes the following code, which can be triggered by users through
    a button in the Main Menu:\r\n\r\npublic void RestorePurchases()\r\n{\r\n   var
    apple = storeExtensionProvider.GetExtension<IAppleExtensions>();\r\n\r\n    apple.RestoreTransactions((success)
    =>\r\n    {\r\n        if(success)\r\n        {\r\n            addCouch();\r\n       
    }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhile testing the application, the Programmer notices
    that users can obtain multiple instances of the same unique item in their inventory.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is the root cause of this issue?"
  wrongAnswer1: The Programmer must implement receipt validation.
  wrongAnswer2: The user has changed accounts.
  wrongAnswer3: The product has been added multiple times in the IAP initialization
    code.
  correctAnswer: An item should only be granted inside ProcessPurchase().
  showAnswer: 'The root cause of this issue is that an item should only be granted
    inside ProcessPurchase()method and not after checking the return of the RestoreTransaction.
    The return of the RestoreTransaction only tells you that the restoration process
    succeeded.

    

    The root cause of this issue is not that the user has
    changed accounts. Even on the same account, the issue would still occur because
    the item is being added in the wrong method.

    

    The root cause of this
    issue is not that you must implement receipt validation. Receipt validation is
    only involved during purchase and not on restoration.

    

    The root cause
    of this issue is not that the product has been added multiple times in the IAP
    initialization code. The item is added every time the user clicks on the button
    to restore purchases.'
