  question: 'A Programmer is creating a simulation for XR platforms. The simulation
    will run on Windows desktops and HoloLens.

    

    The Programmer needs
    to determine the UI affordances that will work on both the desktop and the HoloLens.

    

    Which
    two UI affordances should the Programmer identify?'
  wrongAnswer1: An exit sign anchors to the bottom left of the screen to allow users
    to quit the simulation and a sound clip plays to simulate movement as the user
    moves through physical space.
  wrongAnswer2: A doorknob illuminates as the user looks towards it and an exit sign
    anchors to the bottom left of the screen to allow users to quit the simulation.
  wrongAnswer3: "A sound clip plays to simulate movement as the user moves through
    physical space and an exit sign anchors to the bottom left of the screen to allow
    users to quit the simulation.\r"
  correctAnswer: A doorknob illuminates as the user looks towards it and a menu item
    is highlighted so that the user can interact with it.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should identify a menu item that is highlighted so
    that the user can interact with it. This affordance works the same on both desktop
    computers and the HoloLens. It is intuitive in both the physical world and in
    virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR).

    

    The
    Programmer should also identify a doorknob that illuminates as the user looks
    towards it. On the desktop, a dot icon representing the centre of the screen
    (and user look at) can be used to identify the user''s line of sight.

    

    The
    Programmer should not anchor an exit sign to the bottom left of the screen because
    fixing UI to the screen can cause nausea in VR(XR) experiences.

    

    The
    Programmer should not identify a sound clip that plays to simulate movement as
    the user moves through physical space. This only works for the HoloLens because
    a desktop usually remains at a fixed location.'
