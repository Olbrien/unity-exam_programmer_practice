  question: "A Programmer uses the following code to load a game scene from the start
    scene of a children's rhythm game:\r\n\r\nusing UnityEngine; \r\nusing UnityEngine.SceneManagement;\r\n\r\npublic
    class SceneLoader : MonoBehaviour { \r\n\r\nvoid LoadScene(){ \r\n          
    SceneManager.LoadScene(\"GameScene\", LoadSceneMode.Additive); \r\n      } \r\n
    } \r\n\r\nIn the Editor, the game scene runs perfectly. A significant lag between
    scenes occurs when the game is played on a mobile device.\r\n\r\nHow should the
    Programmer minimize this disruption between scenes when the scene is already
    optimized?"
  wrongAnswer1: Use SceneManager.MergeScenes() and hide the menu items.
  wrongAnswer2: Use SceneManager.GetActiveScene() to switch scenes.
  wrongAnswer3: Use SceneManager.CreateScene() and SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene().
  correctAnswer: Use SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync() with a loading screen.
  showAnswer: "You should use SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync() with a loading screen
    to minimize disruption between scenes. This makes the scene load asynchronously
    in the background.\r\n\r\nYou should not use SceneManager.GetActiveScene() to
    switch scenes because this only returns the current active scene.\r\n\r\nYou
    should not use SceneManager.CreateScene() and SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene().
    SceneManager.CreateScene() will create a new empty scene and \r\n\r\nSceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene()
    is used only to transfer existing game objects between already loaded scenes.\r\n\r\nYou
    should not use SceneManager.MergeScenes() and hide the menu items to minimize
    disruption between scenes. Because this is used to merge the content from one
    scene into another, this will create a major disruption. Also, the content of
    the start scene will be in the game scene."
