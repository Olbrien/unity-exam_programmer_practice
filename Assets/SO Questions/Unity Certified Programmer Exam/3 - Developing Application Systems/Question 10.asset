  question: "A Programmer is creating a track simulation. As a player runs a 100-meter
    race, the Programmer wants to keep track of the number of meters run. The Programmer
    writes the following partial code (line numbers are for reference only):\r\n\r\n01
    public class Score : MonoBehaviour {\r\n02 \r\n03   public Transform runner;\r\n04    
    public Text scoreText;\r\n05\r\n06        void Update () {\r\n07\r\n08        
    }\r\n09 }\r\n\r\nThe runner instance represents the location of the runner. The
    scoreText instance represents the displayed meters.\r\n\r\nWhich code segment
    should the Programmer write at line 07?"
  wrongAnswer1: scoreText.text = runner.position;
  wrongAnswer2: scoreText.text = runner.position.z;
  wrongAnswer3: scoreText.text = runner;
  correctAnswer: scoreText.text = runner.position.z.ToString("0");
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use the following code segment:

    

    scoreText.text
    = runner.position.z.ToString("0");

    

    The runner.position.z property
    represents the position of the runner on the Z axis. The ToString("0") method
    converts that decimal to a string value rounded to the nearest whole number.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use the following code segment:

    

    scoreText.text
    = runner.position;

    

    The text property is of type string, but the
    position property is of type Vector3d.

    

    The Programmer should not
    use the following code segment:

    

    scoreText.text = runner.position.z;

    

    The
    text property is of type string, but the position.z property is of type float.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use the following code segment:

    

    scoreText.text
    = runner;

    

    Setting the text property to runner creates a compilation
    error because runner is of type Transform.'
