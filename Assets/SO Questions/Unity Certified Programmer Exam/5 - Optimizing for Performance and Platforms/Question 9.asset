  question: 'A successful high-end game for PC is receiving a limited port to mobile
    devices in order to advertise the release of its sequel. There will be limited
    content added, and a significant portion will be removed, but the publisher has
    allocated a generous budget to the port. It is understood that the quality will
    not be the same as on PC, and the important goal is to reach as wide an audience
    as possible. Older mobile hardware needs to be supported.

    

    What change
    should a Programmer make to achieve better performance on the targeted hardware?'
  wrongAnswer1: Reduce LOD levels from four to two.
  wrongAnswer2: Increase the Mip Map Priority of all Texures.
  wrongAnswer3: Convert all audio clips from stereo to mono.
  correctAnswer: Convert the project from linear to gamma.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should convert the project from linear color space
    to gamma. Linear color space is newer but is more calculation intensive. Older
    devices, especially with mobile, do not have the capability of processing linear
    color space assets and have no way to convert these to gamma. A large portion
    of the intended demographic will be excluded without this change.

    

    The
    Programmer should not convert audio clips from stereo to mono. This is not a
    restriction of mobile hardware. Most mobile devices will automatically convert
    stereo to mono if there is not support to play stereo audio files.

    

    The
    Programmer should not increase Mip Map Priority of any Textures. This controls
    the priority of streaming mip maps, as well as the quality. At best this would
    have no effect, and at worst it would decrease performance.

    

    The
    Programmer should not reduce LOD levels to two. This would likely have minimal
    impact, or negatively impact the game. LODs are used to decrease the complexity
    of models and materials rendered at a distance where details cannot be perceived.
    Reducing the number of levels will cause objects to be culled too near the viewer,
    or noticeably transition from one LOD to another.  At worst, highly detailed
    models will be used farther out than needed.'
