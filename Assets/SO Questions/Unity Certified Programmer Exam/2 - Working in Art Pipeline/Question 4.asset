  question: "A Programmer is working on a dark and moody room and must create a flickering
    torch that casts a dancing, eerie shadow over the walls, floor, and ceiling.
    The Programmer writes these functions on a MonoBehaviour attached to the torch:\r\n\r\nvoid
    Start()\r\n{\r\n    Light light = GetComponent<Light>();\r\n    light.lightMapBakeType
    = LightMapBakeType.Mixed;\r\n    light.type = LightType.Area;\r\n    light.shadows
    = LightShadows.Soft;\r\n    light.range = 5f;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid Update()\r\n{\r\n   
    GetComponent<Light>().intensity = Mathf.PerlinNoise(Time.time, 0);\r\n} \r\n\r\nThe
    torch does not cast any light or shadow during run time. The light is set to
    the default values in the Editor.\r\n\r\nWhat should the Programmer change for
    this code to work as required?"
  wrongAnswer1: Set light.shadows to LightShadows.Hard.
  wrongAnswer2: Set light.lightBakeType to LightmapBakeType.Realtime.
  wrongAnswer3: Set light.range to 10.
  correctAnswer: Set light.type to LightType.Point.
  showAnswer: 'You should set light.type to LightType.Point to make the code to work
    as required. Since the light and shadow need to be "dancing," the light.lightMapBakeType
    needs to be LightMapBakeType.Realtime or LightMapBakeType.Mixed. Because LightType.Area
    only works in LightMapBakeType.Baked mode, you must choose a LightType that supports
    LightMapBakeType.Realtime or LightMapBakeType.Mixed (such as LightType.Point).


    You
    should not set light.lightBakeType to LightmapBakeType.Realtime to make the code
    work as required. LightType.Area does not support LightMapBakeType.Mixed.


    You
    should not set light.range to 10 to make the code to work as required. The range
    defines how far the light effect extends. Because the light.type is set as LightType.Area
    and the light.lightMapBakeType to LightMapBakeType.Mixed, the light will not
    cause any effect, regardless of distance.


    You should not set light.shadows
    to LightShadows.Hard to make the code work as required. The light.shadows setting
    only defines the level of detail desired on the shadows.'
