  question: 'You have been assigned a task from your technical lead to store the
    800

    non-player character (NPC) prefabs. Either one of these prefabs can
    be

    picked and dropped into the game to roam around. This system needs to
    be

    user-friendly for our designers and ideally, all selections of NPC should

    come
    from the Inspector window. There is also a chance the number of

    enemies
    will increase from the original 800.


    How will you prepare to issue these
    NPCs?'
  wrongAnswer1: 'Simply create a script to store a public array that will accommodate
    the

    creation of each prefab.'
  wrongAnswer2: 'Make a class containing a private serialize field list of NPC prefabs
    and

    have each class of the NPC create an instance of an NPC at runtime.'
  wrongAnswer3: Create all 800+ NPCs at runtime and store them out of the camera
    view.
  correctAnswer: "Create a Scriptable Object containing an array of referenced prefabs.\r"
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
