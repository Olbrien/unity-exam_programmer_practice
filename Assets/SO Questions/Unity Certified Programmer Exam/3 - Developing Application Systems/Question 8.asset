  question: "A Programmer is developing a sports game in which two teams of 16 players
    each can compete.\r\n\r\nEach player has an individual score. The game score
    is calculated by adding all individual scores of the members of each team.\r\n\r\nTo
    analyze game progression, the Programmer writes a custom event to track the scores
    of each team member and writes the code shown:\r\n\r\npublic const int TEAM_SIZE
    = 16;\r\n     public class TeamMember\r\n     {\r\n         public int score;\r\n    
    }\r\n     public class Team\r\n     {\r\n         public string teamName;\r\n        
    public List<TeamMember> players;\r\n     }\r\n     public void logTeamScores(Team
    team)\r\n     {\r\n         Dictionary<string, object> eventParams = new Dictionary<string,
    object>();\r\n         eventParams.Add(\"teamName\", team.teamName);\r\n        
    for(int i = 0; i < TEAM_SIZE; i++)\r\n         {\r\n             var player =
    team.players[i];\r\n             eventParams.Add(\"player_\" + i, player.score);\r\n        
    }\r\n         Analytics.CustomEvent(\"teamStatus\", eventParams);\r\n     } \r\nThe
    Programmer reviews the dashboard and notices that no events are being logged.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is the root cause of this issue?"
  wrongAnswer1: Analytics.limitUserTracking must be set to false.
  wrongAnswer2: The custom event data format is not valid.
  wrongAnswer3: The Programmer must manually call Analytics.FlushEvents().
  correctAnswer: The custom event has too many parameters.
  showAnswer: 'The root cause of this issue is that the custom event has too many
    parameters. Only 10 custom parameters can be set in the dictionary.

    

    The
    root cause of this issue is not that the custom event data format is invalid.
    The custom event receives a string and a Dictionary<string, object> as it is
    being done by the Programmer.

    

    The root cause of this issue is not
    that Analytics.limitUserTracking is set to false. This parameter is used to anonymize
    data. When set to true, it prevents the Analytics system from sending the users
    the SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier.

    

    The root cause of this issue
    is not that you must manually call Analytics.FlushEvents(). The FlushEvents method
    is usually used only for testing purposes. '
