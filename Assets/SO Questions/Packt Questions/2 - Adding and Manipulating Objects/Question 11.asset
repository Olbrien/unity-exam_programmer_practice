  question: 'You have moved studios and jumped on a new game project where you are

    in
    a desert defending a fort from 6,000 donkeys charging to destroy your

    civilization.
    Your only line of defense is throwing heavy wet bean bags to

    tire the donkeys
    out. To target each donkey, you use a raycast system that

    makes contact
    with the mesh collider on either donkey. Your head of

    development has now
    requested 20,000 donkeys to up the ante. We are

    now starting to notice
    the performance of the game has drastically

    dropped. Everyone in the team
    is making an effort so that all 20,000

    donkeys are in the game.


    What
    changes can you make to improve the game''s performance?'
  wrongAnswer1: 'Make the donkeys slightly bigger so more space is taken up in the

    environment.'
  wrongAnswer2: 'Create a special donkey layer mask so the rest of the environment
    is

    ignored.'
  wrongAnswer3: Shorten your raycast's length.
  correctAnswer: Replace the mesh colliders with sphere colliders.
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
