  question: 'A Programmer uses Unity Analytics to track which stages of a game each
    player has already cleared. The Programmer must add tracking for how much gold
    a player accumulates in each stage by using a custom parameter named stage_gold.
    The value of the stage_gold parameter must come from a field named Score.gold.

    

    The
    Programmer decides to use the LevelComplete method in the AnalyticsEvent class.
    The LevelComplete method should be called after the stage is completed, and after
    a custom method named StageCompleted is invoked.

    

    What code should
    the Programmer use to implement the StageCompleted method?'
  wrongAnswer1: "public void StageCompleted(){\r\nList customParams = new List ();\r\ncustomParams.Add(\"stage_gold
    = \" + Score.gold.ToString());\r\n\r\nAnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId,
    customParams);\r\n}\r"
  wrongAnswer2: 'public void StageCompleted(){

    Dictionary<string, object> customParams
    = new Dictionary<string, string>();

    customParams.Add("stage_gold", "100");

    

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId,
    null, customParams);

    }'
  wrongAnswer3: 'public void StageCompleted(){

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId);

    }'
  correctAnswer: 'public void StageCompleted(){

    Dictionary<string, object>
    customParams = new Dictionary<string, object>();

    customParams.Add("stage_gold",
    Score.gold);

    

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId, null,
    customParams);

    }'
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should implement the StageCompleted method by using
    the following code:

    

    public void StageCompleted(){

    Dictionary<string,
    object> customParams = new Dictionary<string, object>();

    customParams.Add("stage_gold",
    Score.gold);

    

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId, null,
    customParams);

    }

    

    The AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete can be invoked
    by using custom parameters. To accomplish this, in addition to the level ID,
    you must pass in a Dictionary<string, object> containing the custom parameters
    that you want to send. In this case, the Score.gold is being sent inside the
    customParams dictionary using the string "stage_gold" as the key.

    

    The
    Programmer should not implement the StageCompleted method by using the following
    code:

    

    public void StageCompleted(){

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId);

    }

    

    The
    Programmer should also pass the amount of gold acquired by the player in the
    given stage. This should be done by using the LevelComplete overload that can
    receive custom parameters.

    

    The Programmer should not implement the
    StageCompleted method by using the following code:

    

    public void StageCompleted(){

    Dictionary<string,
    object> customParams = new Dictionary<string, string>();

    customParams.Add("stage_gold",
    "100");

    

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId, null, customParams);

    }

    

    The
    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete can be invoked by using custom parameters, but the
    custom parameters must be a Dictionary<string, object> and not Dictionary<string,string>.
    This code will not compile.

    

    The Programmer should not implement
    the StageCompleted method by using the following code:

    

    public void
    StageCompleted(){

    List<string> customParams = new List <string>();

    customParams.Add("stage_gold
    = " + Score.gold.ToString());

    

    AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete(currentGameLevelId,
    customParams);

    }

    

    The AnalyticsEvent.LevelComplete can be invoked
    by using custom parameters, but there is not any overload that receives a List<string>,
    only a Dictionary<string, object>. This code will not compile.'
