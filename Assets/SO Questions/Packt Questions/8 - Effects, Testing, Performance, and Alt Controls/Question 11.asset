  question: 'You are testing a scene and applying different lights to it. Within
    the scene,

    you have a series of game objects:


    .Decorative lights

    .The
    sun

    .A car with its hazard lights on

    .A garage


    The car is
    parked in the garage. Around the inside of the garage, walls are

    decorative
    lights, and the sun is shining through the garage door.


    You have enabled
    Global Illumination to increase the realism of the sun. As

    impressive as
    this looks, your scene now takes a high amount of memory

    usage.


    How
    can we keep our scene looking as impressive but continue to keep the

    memory
    usage low?'
  wrongAnswer1: Set Indirect Multiplier to 0 on the sunlight.
  wrongAnswer2: "Change Light Mode for the lights to Baked.\r"
  wrongAnswer3: Disable Realtime Global Illumination in the Lighting settings.
  correctAnswer: "Set Indirect Multiplier to 0 on the decorative lights, that is,
    the car's\r\nhazard lights.\r"
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
