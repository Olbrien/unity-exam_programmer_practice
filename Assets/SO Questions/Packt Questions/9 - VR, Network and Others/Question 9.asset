  question: 'You have developed a VR game that is getting reports from your testers

    stating
    that the game lags in certain parts. Your camera''s Rendering Path is

    set
    to Forward. You have decided to not reallocate the memory of the eye

    texture
    at runtime to avoid any other performance conflicts.


    If a frame rate drop
    is detected, we can set a property in our XRSetting

    class to help combat
    this issue.


    Which property is the most effective?'
