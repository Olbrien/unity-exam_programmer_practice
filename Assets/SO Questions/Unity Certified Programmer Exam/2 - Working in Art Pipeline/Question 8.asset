  question: 'The Game Design Document (GDD) specifies that when a user interacts
    with a treasure chest in the scene, a cutscene should play. The entire cutscene
    is made up of a single timeline sequence. During testing, the designer informs
    the Programmer that there should be a 2-second delay between the treasure chest
    interaction and the cutscene playing.


    What adjustments should be made to
    the PlayableDirector component to achieve this change?'
  wrongAnswer1: Set the CurrentTime value to the length of the treasure chest interaction
    plus 2 seconds.
  wrongAnswer2: Set the CurrentTime value to 2.
  wrongAnswer3: Set the InitialTime value to the length of the treasure chest interaction
    plus 2 seconds.
  correctAnswer: Set the InitialTime value to 2.
  showAnswer: 'You should set the InitialTime value to 2 to achieve this change.
    This is the value in seconds that you want the PlayableDirector to delay the
    beginning of the animation.


    You should not set the CurrentTime value to
    2 to achieve this change. This would only skip 2 seconds of the animation. For
    example, if your animation has 5 seconds, it would only play the interval from
    2 seconds to 5 seconds.


    You should not set the InitialTime value to the
    length of the treasure chest interaction plus 2 seconds to achieve this change.
    The InitialTime must have the value in seconds that you want to delay the beginning
    of the animation after the interaction occurs.


    You should not set the CurrentTime
    value to the length of the treasure chest interaction plus 2 seconds to achieve
    this change. This would skip most of the animation.'
