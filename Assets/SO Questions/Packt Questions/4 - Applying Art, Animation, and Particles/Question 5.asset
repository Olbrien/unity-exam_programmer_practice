  question: 'You are prototyping a third-person character for a SWAT team game, and

    we
    are going to need to get some fundamental controls up and running.

    Our
    character is currently set to run, lean, and shoot in all directions.

    Ideally,
    we want it so our character can shoot and jump, or shoot and lean.

    Currently,
    our Base Movement is set to Override Blending, while the other

    layers are
    set to Additive Blending.

    

    In which order should the Animation Layers
    be set?'
