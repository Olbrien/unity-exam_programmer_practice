  question: How can we improve performance with a particle system?
  wrongAnswer1: 'Increase the particle lifetime so that more particles can be reused
    in

    memory rather than generating new ones.'
  wrongAnswer2: 'Randomize properties between two curves rather than two constants
    to

    reduce the number of random numbers that need to be generated.'
  wrongAnswer3: 'Reduce the speed of particles to reduce the number of physics updates

    that
    are needed.'
  correctAnswer: 'Reduce the number and size of the particles to reduce the number
    of

    pixels on the screen that need to be alpha blended.'
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
