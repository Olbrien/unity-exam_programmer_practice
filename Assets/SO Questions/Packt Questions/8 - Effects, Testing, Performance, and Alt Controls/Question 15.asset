  question: 'We have a tech demo where the player walks down a sci-fi corridor and

    through
    the window, the sun shines through and lights up the corridor. We

    have
    applied a bloom effect from our post-processing stack. We want some

    of
    the game assets in the corridor to shine and glow like what should be

    expected
    from a bloom effect. An artist has informed you that all art assets

    have
    emission maps, but their levels vary.


    Which property do we need to alter
    to make it so our bloom effects cover

    the lower-level emission maps?'
