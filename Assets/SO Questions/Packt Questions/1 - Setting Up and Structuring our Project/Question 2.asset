  question: 'We have a mobile app that will need to support low performing tablets.
    In

    our app, we will have a mini-game where the player will be able to throw

    an
    unlimited supply of basketballs into a hoop. However, only 10

    basketballs
    are in the view of the camera. Due to this, the programmer has

    made a mini-game
    so that the same 10 basketballs will be used instead of

    instantiating a
    new basketball on each throw.

    The programmer is aware that the design pattern
    for reusing the basketball

    assets has a name. What is this design pattern''s
    name?'
