  question: 'We have created a VR game where our player is inside a room with a

    locked
    door that will not open.


    The room contains a window and outside is

    a
    field of grass with mountains in the distance.

    Everything in the player''s
    scene is 3D modeled and textured, and there is

    also one-directional light.


    When
    the player walks toward the window, the game begins to lag due to

    the spike
    in draw calls.


    How can we improve the performance of our game?'
  wrongAnswer1: 'Disable Generate Mip Maps in the Texture Import Settings for all
    textures

    in the distance.'
  wrongAnswer2: Add fog to occlude objects in the distance.
  wrongAnswer3: Bake the lighting from the directional light and disable it in the
    level.
  correctAnswer: "Remove the 3D models in the distance and replace them with a rendered\r\nskybox.\r"
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
