  question: 'A driving game''s input system is mapped so that the horizontal input
    axis controls steering. During testing, it is discovered that some joystick devices
    register steering input even when the stick is centered.

    

    Which change
    should be made to the axis in the input system to resolve this issue?'
  wrongAnswer1: Set Snap to true.
  wrongAnswer2: Increase Gravity.
  wrongAnswer3: Decrease Sensitivity.
  correctAnswer: Increase Deadzone.
  showAnswer: 'You should increase the Deadzone in the input system to resolve this
    issue. Inside an InputManager entry, the Dead field defines the minimum value
    on the axes that should not be considered 0. By increasing the Dead value, you
    are telling the input system to consider a wider range of values to be zero.

    

    You
    should not increase Gravity in the input system to resolve this issue. The input
    system Gravity parameter only affects how fast the input will go back to neutral
    when you release the button/key.

    

    You should not set Snap to true
    in the input system to resolve this issue. The Snap parameter only sets the button/key
    value to snap to zero instantly instead of gradually once you release the button/key.

    

    You
    should not decrease Sensitivity in the input system to resolve this issue. The
    Sensitivity parameter only defines how fast the value will change from 0 to 1
    when you press a button/key.'
