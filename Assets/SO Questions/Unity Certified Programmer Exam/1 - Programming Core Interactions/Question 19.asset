  question: "A Programmer is working on a first-person shooter game for PC and must
    implement a mini-map to show a smaller view of the player's location. \r\n\r\nIt
    was decided that the Programmer should use a second camera directly above the
    player's head, pointed down. This camera must follow the player's position without
    any smoothing. Also the mini-map should cover 20% of the screen area horizontally
    and vertically and be located in the bottom left corner. The Programmer decides
    to configure the mini-map camera in the Start() method.\r\n\r\nWhich code should
    the Programmer use to set the camera?"
  wrongAnswer1: "Void Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth
    + 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0.2f, 0.2f, 0, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = player.transform;\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0,
    5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0,
    0);\r\n   }"
  wrongAnswer2: "Void Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth
    - 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f, 0.2f);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = player.transform;\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0,
    5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0,
    0);\r\n   }"
  wrongAnswer3: "Void Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth
    + 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f, 0.2f);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = camera.main.transform;\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new
    Vector3(0, 5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90,
    0, 0);\r\n   }"
  correctAnswer: "Void Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth
    + 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f, 0.2f);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = player.transform;\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0,
    5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0,
    0);\r\n   }"
  showAnswer: "The Programmer should initialize the mini-map camera with the following
    code:\r\n\r\nVoid Start()\r\n{\r\n         minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth
    + 1;\r\n         minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f, 0.2f);\r\n        
    minimapCamera.transform.parent = player.transform;\r\n         minimapCamera.transform.localPosition
    = new Vector3(0, 5, 0);\r\n         minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90,
    0, 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nFirst the mini-map camera must have a higher Depth value than
    the main camera. This will ensure that it is always visible on the screen. Second,
    the width and the height of the Viewport Rect of the mini-map camera must be
    set to 0.2, while X and Y are set to zero. This will make it only take 20% of
    the screen starting from the bottom left corner. Third, the camera should be
    set as a child Gameobject of the player Gameobject. This will ensure that whenever
    the players move, the mini-map camera will move with him. Finally, the camera
    is positioned directly above the player's position and pointed down by rotating
    90 degrees on the X axis.\r\n\r\nThe Programmer should not initialize the mini-map
    camera with the following code:\r\n\r\nVoid Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth
    = Camera.main.depth - 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f,
    0.2f);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent = player.transform;\r\n       
    minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation
    = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0, 0);\r\n   }\r\n\r\nThe issue here is the line the \"minimapCamera.depth
    = Camera.main.depth - 1;\". This will make the mini-map camera to render behind
    the main camera and never appear since the main camera covers the entire viewport.\r\n\r\nThe
    Programmer should not initialize the mini-map camera with the following code:\r\n\r\nVoid
    Start()\r\n   {\r\n        minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth + 1;\r\n       
    minimapCamera.rect = new Rect(0.2f, 0.2f, 0, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = player.transform;\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0,
    5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0,
    0);\r\n   }\r\n\r\nThe issue here is the line the \"minimapCamera.rect = new
    Rect(0.2f, 0.2f, 0, 0);\". This will make the mini-map camera Viewport Rect to
    be positioned 20% to the right and 20% from the bottom of the Viewport and cover
    all the remaining area of the screen.\r\n\r\nThe Programmer should not initialize
    the mini-map camera with the following code:\r\n\r\nVoid Start()\r\n   {\r\n       
    minimapCamera.depth = Camera.main.depth + 1;\r\n        minimapCamera.rect =
    new Rect(0, 0, 0.2f, 0.2f);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.parent = camera.main.transform;\r\n       
    minimapCamera.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 5, 0);\r\n        minimapCamera.transform.rotation
    = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0, 0);\r\n   }\r\n\r\nThe issue here is the line the \"minimapCamera.transform.parent
    = Camera.main.transform;\". This sets the mini-map camera as a child Gameobject
    of the main camera and not the player. If the player moves, the mini-map camera
    will not move with him.\r"
