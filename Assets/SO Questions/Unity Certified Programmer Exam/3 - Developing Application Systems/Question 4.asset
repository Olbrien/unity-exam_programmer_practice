  question: "A Programmer is creating a simulation that enables users to design their
    homes. Users must be able to click a button that represents a specific piece
    of furniture. The following class exists:\r\n\r\npublic class Home : MonoBehaviour\r\n\r\n
    {\r\n }\r\n\r\n The Programmer writes the following code to create a button:\r\n\r\n
    GUI.Button(new Rect(10, 10, 150, 100), \"Table\"));\r\n\r\n Which method should
    the Programmer implement to place the code?"
  wrongAnswer1: Update
  wrongAnswer2: FixedUpdate
  wrongAnswer3: Start
  correctAnswer: OnGUI
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should implement the OnGUI method. This method is called
    to render GUI objects and handle GUI events. This method may be called multiple
    times per frame to handle multiple GUI events.

    

    The Programmer should
    not implement the Start method. This method is called only once. You should use
    this method to initialize game objects.

    

    The Programmer should not
    implement the Update method. This method is called once per frame. However, this
    is not the method that you should use to implement GUI rendering. You should
    use this method to manipulate game objects.

    

    The Programmer should
    not implement the FixedUpdate method. This method may be called several times
    per frame. However, this is not the method that you should use to implement GUI
    rendering. You should use this method to manipulate game objects.'
