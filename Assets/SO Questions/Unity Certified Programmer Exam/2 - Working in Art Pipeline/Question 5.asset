  question: 'A Game Design Document (GDD) specifies that the user has a flashlight
    item that must be regularly refreshed with batteries. As the flashlight''s power
    begins to drain, the light slowly becomes dimmer. Once the flashlight has less
    than 25% power remaining, the light begins to flicker randomly.


    Which light
    property should be controlled to meet these requirements?'
  wrongAnswer1: light.renderMode
  wrongAnswer2: light.bounceIntensity
  wrongAnswer3: light.range
  correctAnswer: light.intensity
  showAnswer: 'You should control the light.intensity property to meet the requirements.
    The intensity controls how bright the light is. As the power begins to drain,
    the intensity should start to be lowered proportionally. When the battery reaches
    25 percent, the intensity should be set randomly to 0 and back to 25 percent
    to produce the flicker effect.


    You should not control the light.range property
    to meet the requirements. This property can affect how bright a light appears
    at a certain distance. Changing this property may have unwanted effects, such
    as decreasing the radius the light is able to illuminate.


    You should not
    control the light.bounceIntensity property to meet the requirements. This property
    defines how strongly the light bounces off objects, not its intensity.


    You
    should not control the light.renderMode property to meet the requirements. This
    property defines the fidelity and performance of the light, not its intensity.'
