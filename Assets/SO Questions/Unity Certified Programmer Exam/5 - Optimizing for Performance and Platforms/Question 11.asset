  question: "A Programmer is creating an XR project. The Programmer finds the connected
    headset in the XRSettings.supportedDevices array and loads it through the following
    method:\r\n\r\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice)\r\n{\r\n   XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\r\n  
    yield return null;\r\n   Debug.Log(XRSettings.loadedDeviceName);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe
    Log shows that the loadedDeviceName is the connected headset, but nothing renders
    to the device.\r\n\r\nWhat should the Programmer do to fix this issue?"
  wrongAnswer1: Pass in XRSettings.loadedDeviceName to LoadDevice() when the coroutine
    is called.
  wrongAnswer2: Set the value for XRSettings.renderViewportScale after the device
    has been loaded.
  wrongAnswer3: Set XRSettings.showDeviceView to true after the yield.
  correctAnswer: Call XRSettings.enabled = true after the device has been loaded.
  showAnswer: 'You should set XRSettings.enabled = true after the device has been
    loaded to fix the issue. This enables the XR mode for the application.

    

    You
    should not pass in XRSettings.loadedDeviceName to LoadDevice() when the coroutine
    is called to fix the issue. Because no device has been loaded yet, no value would
    exist in XRSettings.loadedDeviceName.

    

    You should not set the value
    for XRSettings.renderViewportScale after the device has been loaded to fix the
    issue. This parameter is used to define how much of the eye texture is to be
    used for rendering.

    

    You should not set XRSettings.showDeviceView
    to true after the yield to fix the issue. This property has been deprecated.'
