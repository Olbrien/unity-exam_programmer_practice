  question: "A Programmer creates a procedurally generated 3D tile based environment.
    The design requires that a number of AI-driven cats intelligently navigate through
    this procedural environment using the NavMesh. The Programmer calls the following
    code after the environment is generated:\r\n\r\n[SerializeField] Bounds navmeshBounds;\r\n[SerializeField]
    LayerMask layerMask;\r\n[SerializeField] float agentSize = 1;\r\n\r\nvoid GenerateNavigation()\r\n{\r\n   
    NavMeshBuildSettings settings = new NavMeshBuildSettings();\r\n    List<NavMeshBuildSource>
    sources = new List<NavMeshBuildSource>();\r\n    List<NavMeshBuildMarkup> markup
    = new List<NavMeshBuildMarkup>();\r\n    settings.agentRadius = agentSize;\r\n   
    settings.agentSlope = 45;\r\n    settings.agentClimb = agentSize/2f;\r\n    NavMeshBuilder.CollectSources(\r\n       
    navmeshBounds, layerMask, \r\n        NavMeshCollectGeometry.PhysicsColliders,
    0, \r\n        markup, sources);\r\n    NavMeshData data = NavMeshBuilder.BuildNavMeshData(\r\n       
    settings, sources, \r\n        navmeshBounds, Vector3.zero, \r\n        Quaternion.identity);\r\n   
    NavMesh.AddNavMeshData(data);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe cats are unable to walk on slopes.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should the Programmer do to solve this issue?"
  wrongAnswer1: Reduce settings.tileSize to a value smaller than the agentClimb before
    building the NavMeshData.
  wrongAnswer2: Add the cats as items in the markup list with ignoreFromBuild set
    to true.
  wrongAnswer3: Make sure the cats are on a layer separate from what is included
    in layerMask.
  correctAnswer: Set settings.agentHeight to agentSize before building the NavMeshData.
  showAnswer: 'You should set settings.agentHeight to agentSize before building the
    NavMeshData to solve this issue. The agentHeight is the height of the agent,
    and agentClimb must be lower than this value. Because agentHeight is not defined,
    it defaults to 0. The cats cannot climb when their height is 0.

    

    You
    should not add the cats as items in the markup list with ignoreFromBuild set
    to true. NavMeshBuildMarkup provides some control over how objects are treated
    when collecting sources to build a NavMesh. If ignoreFromBuild is set to true,
    you must also set the root to specify which gameObject the markup applies to.
    Excluding the cats from the query does not make them able to walk on slopes.

    

    You
    should not reduce settings.tileSize to a value smaller than the agentClimb before
    building the NavMeshData. The tileSize value specifies the size (in voxel units)
    used to build the mesh, which determines how accurately the resulting NavMesh
    represents the geometry. Although this may affect the pathfinding of the cats
    due to the change in accuracy of the Navmesh, setting this smaller than agentClimb
    has no effect on walking on slopes.

    

    You should not make sure the
    cats are on a layer separate from what is included inlayerMask. NavMeshBuilder.CollectSources()
    takes a collection of data that will be used to build the NavMesh. When passing
    a layerMask to this method, that layer''s geometry is included as input for baking.
    Although this ensures that cats are on a separate layer, it will not make them
    able to walk on slopes.'
