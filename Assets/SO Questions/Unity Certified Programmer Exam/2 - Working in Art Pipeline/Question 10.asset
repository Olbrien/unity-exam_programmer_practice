  question: 'A Programmer must implement a bomb for a game in which the user drops
    bombs on targets from an airplane. The user can drop bombs of various payloads.
    Larger payloads have larger explosions. After the explosion is complete, a fire
    is created by instantiating a fire particle system in the location of the explosion.
    Based on the size of the payload, the fire should burn for a longer period of
    time. The Programmer must set the Particle System duration equal to the payloadSize
    variable.


    Which solution should be used to accomplish this?'
  wrongAnswer1: var duration = fireParticleSystem.main.duration; duration = payloadSize;
  wrongAnswer2: fireParticleSystem.main.startLifetime = payloadSize
  wrongAnswer3: fireParticleSystem.duration = payloadSize;
  correctAnswer: var mainModule = fireParticleSystem.main; mainModule.duration =
    payloadSize;
  showAnswer: 'You should use the following solution to achieve this:


    var mainModule
    = fireParticleSystem.main; mainModule.duration = payloadSize;


    This code
    fetches the fireParticleSystem.main into the mainModule, and then it sets the
    mainModule.duration = payloadSize. This sets the duration of the particle system
    equal to the payloadSize;


    You should not use fireParticleSystem.duration
    = payloadSize because it is obsolete.


    You should not use fireParticleSystem.main.startLifetime
    = payloadSize. You cannot modify the return value of fireParticleSystem.main
    because it is not a variable.


    You should not use var duration = fireParticleSystem.main.duration;
    duration = payloadSize. fireParticleSystem.main.duration is a value type, and
    this will only copy its value to var duration. If you use duration = payloadSize;
    you are setting duration to payloadSize, and not the particle system itself.'
