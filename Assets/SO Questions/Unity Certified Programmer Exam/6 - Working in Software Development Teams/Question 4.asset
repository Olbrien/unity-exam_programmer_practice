  question: "A Programmer is creating several three-dimensional game prototypes in
    Unity. The Programmer decides to enable Unity Collaborate for the prototype projects.
    The Programmer is the owner of the organization that contains the projects. \r\n\r\nThe
    programmer needs to add two more people to create a team. The team must be able
    to access all projects that have Unity Collaborate enabled in the organization.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should the Programmer do first to add the team members?"
  wrongAnswer1: Invite the team members from the Collaborate panel.
  wrongAnswer2: Subscribe to Unity Pro.
  wrongAnswer3: Subscribe to Unity Teams Advanced.
  correctAnswer: Assign a Unity Teams seat to each person.
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should first assign a Unity Teams seat to each teammate.
    To give a team member access to all projects that have Unity Collaborate enabled,
    you must first ensure that the individual has a Unity Teams seat.

    

    The
    Programmer should not subscribe to Unity Teams Advanced first. Both the Basic
    plan and the Advanced plan will support up to three people, so there is no need
    to use a specific plan in this case. Also, subscribing to the Advanced plan will
    not automatically enable access for the team members.

    

    The Programmer
    should not subscribe to Unity Pro first. This version is not required to access
    Unity Collaborate. Also, subscribing to Unity Pro will not automatically enable
    access for the team members.

    

    The Programmer should not invite the
    team members from the Collaborate panel first. This would only grant the team
    members access to a specific project, not all projects.'
