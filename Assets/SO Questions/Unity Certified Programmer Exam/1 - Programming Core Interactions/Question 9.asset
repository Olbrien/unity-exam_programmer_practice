  question: "A Programmer is building a car simulation environment in Unity where
    at any given point in time, at most ten cars can be in the scene and seen on
    the screen. The Programmer uses object pooling to implement this.\r\n\r\nThe
    code is shown below:\r\n\r\nprivate List<Car> pooledCars;\r\n[SerializeField]\r\nprivate
    Car carPrefab;\r\n[SerializeField]\r\nprivate int poolSize;\r\nvoid Start()\r\n{\r\npooledCars
    = new List<Car>();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++) \r\n      {\r\n       
    Car car = Instantiate(carPrefab) as Car;\r\n        car.SetActive(false); \r\n       
    pooledCars.Add(car);\r\n      }\r\n}\r\npublic Car PickCarFromPool() \r\n{\r\n  
    for (int i = 0; i < pooledCars.Count; i++) \r\n   {\r\n     if (!pooledCars[i].activeInHierarchy)
    \r\n     {\r\n       return pooledCars[i];\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   return null;\r\n
    }\r\n\r\nWhat should be the minimum size of the pool to achieve this effect?"
  wrongAnswer1: 11
  wrongAnswer2: 2
  wrongAnswer3: 9
  correctAnswer: 10
  showAnswer: "The minimum size of the pool to achieve this effect is 10. This ensures
    that even if all 10 cars appear simultaneously on the screen, there will be an
    available object on the pool to be used. \r\n\r\nThe minimum size of the pool
    to achieve this effect is not 9. This will cause a null return if a 10th car
    is requested.\r\n\r\nThe minimum size of the pool to achieve this effect is not
    11. This would not cause issues but it would be wasteful because the 11th car
    in the pool would never be used.\r\n\r\nThe minimum size of the pool to achieve
    this effect is not 2. This will cause a null return if a 3rd car is requested."
