  question: "A puzzle game in which players drop blocks is being developed for a
    kiosk at a shopping center. The game can support up to six players. The game
    doubles as an advertisement, with deals and specials advertised along the top
    fifth of the screen. The remainder of the screen is divided horizontally to support
    however many players are currently playing at the start of a round. Each camera
    views the same scene from a different angle, and multiple players must cooperate
    to solve the puzzle.\r\n\r\nAll player Cameras are stored in an array of Cameras
    named playerCameras. A method is being developed to divide up the screen at the
    start of a round:\r\n\r\n    public void SetPlayerCameras(int count) {\r\n        
    for(int i = 0; i < playerCameras.Length; i++) {\r\n             playerCameras[i].enabled
    = (i < count);\r\n             float horizontalPercentage = 1f / count;\r\n           
    //Set\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhat code should the Programmer use to replace
    //Set?"
  wrongAnswer1: playerCameras[i].rect = new Rect(horizontalPercentage * i, 0.2f,
    horizontalPercentage, 0.8f);
  wrongAnswer2: playerCameras[i].rect = new Rect(Screen.width * horizontalPercentage
    * i, Screen.height * 0.2f, Screen.width * horizontalPercentage, Screen.height
    * 0.8f);
  wrongAnswer3: playerCameras[i].rect = new Rect(Screen.width * horizontalPercentage
    * i, 0f, Screen.width * horizontalPercentage, Screen.height * 0.8f);
  correctAnswer: playerCameras[i].rect = new Rect(horizontalPercentage * i, 0f, horizontalPercentage,
    0.8f);
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should set playerCameras[i].rect  to a new Rect(horizontalPercentage
    * i, 0f, horizontalPercentage, 0.8f). Camera.rect operates on percentages of
    the screen, with the first two numbers indicating an offset of X and Y from the
    lower-left corner of the screen. The percentage each camera takes up will act
    as a cumulative offset for the X offset, and the player Cameras will need an
    offset of 0 from the bottom since the advertisement is at the top of the screen.
    The second set of numbers indicate the width and height. The width is equal to
    the percentage of the screen each Camera takes up, calculated as horizontalPercentage,
    and each Camera will always take up 80% of the screen''s vertical space, so 0.8f
    is the height.

    

    The Programmer should not set the Y offset to 0.2f.
    Vertical offset is measured from the bottom of the screen, not the top.

    

    The
    Programmer should not multiply the X offset and width values by Screen.width
    or multiply the Y offset and height values by Screen.height. Camera.rect uses
    percentages of the screen rather than pixel measurements.'
