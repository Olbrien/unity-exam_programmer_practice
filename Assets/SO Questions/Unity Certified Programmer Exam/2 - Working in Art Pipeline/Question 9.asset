  question: 'The NPCs in a game can be forced to dance if the player plays music.
    The dance NPCs perform will depend on the genre of music the player selects.
    The NPC will continue to dance while in range of the music, after which the NPC
    will stop dancing and return to an idle animation. Currently the music genres
    are contained in an enum and include Salsa, HipHop, Swing, Disco, and ChickenDance.
    Many more dances are scheduled to be added, both before launch and after as DLC.


    What
    method can the Programmer use to instruct which dance animation to perform, while
    minimizing the work required to add new dances?'
  wrongAnswer1: Animator.SetBool
  wrongAnswer2: Animator.SetTrigger
  wrongAnswer3: Animator.SetTarget
  correctAnswer: Animator.SetInteger
  showAnswer: "The Programmer should use Animator.SetInteger to pass in the enum
    of the selected genre cast as an integer. In the Animation Controller, a single
    Int Parameter can control what dance is started. New animations need only add
    the genre to the enum and add the condition of equaling the enum's value to the
    transition in. The method might look like this:\r\n\r\n    private void PlayDance(Dance
    genre) {\r\n         anim.SetInteger(\"DanceGenre\", (int)genre);\r\n     }\r\n\r\nWhile
    the Programmer could use Animator.SetBool, this would require extra steps within
    the Unity Editor and is furthermore subject to spelling errors. Therefore, the
    Programmer should not use this technique. After adding the genre to the enum,
    a new Bool Parameter would need to be added to the Animation Controller and used
    in the transition. If the Parameter had the exact same name as the enum, the
    following code could be used:\r\n\r\n    private void PlayDance(Dance genre)
    {\r\n         anim.SetBool(genre.ToString(), true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs with SetBool,
    SetTrigger could be used but carries the same extra steps within the Unity Editor
    and is furthermore subject to spelling errors. Therefore, the Programmer should
    not use this technique. Each new genre would need a new Trigger Parameter added
    to the Animation Controller and used in the transition. Again, if the Parameter
    had the exact same name as the enum, the following code could be used:\r\n\r\n   
    private void PlayDance(Dance genre) {\r\n         anim.SetTrigger(genre.ToString());\r\n   
    }\r\n\r\nThe Programmer should not use Animator.SetTarget. This sets the Avatar
    for the given Animator. While this is useful for retargeting animations, it will
    not help the Programmer to select which genre of music the NPC dances to."
