  question: 'A programmer is creating a visual effect for an online multiplayer game

    that
    will spawn when a player jumps while having rocket boots equipped.


    The
    designer has created a particle system and attached it as a child to an

    empty
    Game Object called BoostEffect.


    The BoostEffect object has both a Network
    Identity and a

    NetworkTransform component on it.


    The BoostEffect
    object is spawned on the network into the level at the

    location of the
    jump, but never moves or rotates after it is spawned. The

    effect does not
    interact with other players on the network but should be

    visible to them.


    What
    property of the NetworkTransform component should the

    programmer change
    from the default value to optimize the impact this

    object will have on
    the connection between the players?'
  wrongAnswer1: Decrease Interpolate Movement Factor to 0.01
  wrongAnswer2: Increase MovementThreshold to 0.005
  wrongAnswer3: Set Transform Sync Mode to Sync Rigidbody 3D
  correctAnswer: Set Network Send Rate to 0
  showAnswer: Explanation not provided for this entire Practice Test.
