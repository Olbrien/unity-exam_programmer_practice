  question: 'In a horror game, the player walks through a dark mine. The only light
    source is a helmet flashlight on the main character.


    What kind of lighting
    setup should the Programmer use to create the helmet flashlight effect?'
  wrongAnswer1: A spotlight that follows the position of the main character's eyes.
  wrongAnswer2: A point light attached as a child to the main character's helmet.
  wrongAnswer3: A point light with a script that tracks the main character's point
    of view.
  correctAnswer: A spotlight attached as a child to the main character's helmet.
  showAnswer: 'You should use a spotlight attached as a child to the main character''s
    helmet to create the effect. The spotlight creates a cone of light that expands
    from its origin to a given direction. By attaching it as a child to the main
    character''s helmet, the spotlight illuminates the area where the character''s
    helmet is pointing.


    You should not use a point light attached as a child
    to the main character''s helmet to create the effect. Because the point light
    illuminates equally in all directions, it would illuminate everything around
    the character and not only where the helmet is pointing.


    You should not
    use a point light with a script that tracks the main character''s point of view
    to create the effect. Because the point light illuminates equally in all directions,
    it would illuminate everything around the character and not only where the helmet
    is pointing.


    You should not use a spotlight that follows the position of
    the main character''s eyes to create the effect. The helmet emits the light,
    not the eyes.'
