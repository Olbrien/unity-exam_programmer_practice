  question: 'A Programmer is creating a game that allows in-app purchases. The Programmer
    wants the app to automatically enable a feature after a user has purchased the
    feature.

    

    Which interface should the Programmer implement?'
  wrongAnswer1: IExtensionProvider
  wrongAnswer2: IStoreController
  wrongAnswer3: IStoreExtension
  correctAnswer: IStoreListener
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should implement the IStoreListener interface. This
    interface defines a method named ProcessPurchase that serves as a callback whenever
    users perform in-app purchases.

    

    The Programmer should not implement
    IStoreExtension. This interface enables you to extend the store purchasing experience.

    

    The
    Programmer should not implement IExtensionProvider. This interface enables you
    to extend the store purchasing experience.

    

    The Programmer should
    not implement IStoreController. An instance of this interface is created by Unity
    when you implement the OnInitialized method of IStoreListener. The IStoreController
    instance enables you to initiate purchases.'
