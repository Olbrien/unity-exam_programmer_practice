  question: 'An application has a robust search feature in its crafting HUD. A Programmer
    must alter the methods that UI Buttons call when clicked, depending on options
    set by the user. The first task involves working on a Button named filterResults.

    

    What
    is the simplest method the Programmer can call on filterResults to add a call
    to a method at runtime?'
  wrongAnswer1: filterResults.HandleEvent
  wrongAnswer2: filterResults.RegisterCallback
  wrongAnswer3: filterResults.Add
  correctAnswer: filterResults.clicked.AddListener
  showAnswer: 'The Programmer should use filterResults.clicked.AddListener to add
    the method as a delegate. The delegate will be executed whenever the Button is
    clicked. This is the simplest solution to implement.  When the method is no longer
    needed, filterResults.clicked.RemoveListener will remove it.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use filterResults.HandleEvent. An EventHandler executes
    a pre-established callback in response to an event. Rather than just respond
    to a Button being clicked, an EventHandler can respond to nearly any Event. While
    this offers flexibility, it also requires much more work than using .clicked.AddListener.

    

    The
    Programmer should not use filterResults.RegisterCallback. This adds an EventHandler,
    which as explained above, would allow for the functionality required, but would
    require much more work.

    

    The Programmer should not use filterResults.Add.
    This adds a UI Element to the Content Container and does not allow the Programmer
    to add a callback in response to the Button being clicked, or any other Event.'
